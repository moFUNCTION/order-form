It involves inserting connector pins into the gold-plated through-holes on the circuit board and applying a certain amount of force to establish the connection. This technology eliminates some of the issues that arise in traditional soldering processes, such as broken or cold soldered pins, resulting in improved reliability and durability of the connector components.",
